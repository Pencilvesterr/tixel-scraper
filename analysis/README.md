# Tixel Data Analysis

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks and analysis code for the Tixel event data.

## Running Jupyter
The Jupyter notebook server is configured in the root docker-compose.yml.

In the `tixel-scraper` directory, run:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Then access it at http://localhost:9999 with no authentication required.

This should have all dependencies to use Jupyter notebook for any data analysis.
